# automate-the-boring-stuff
A collection of the work from Al Sweigart's course Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
Really great learning from his course on Udemy. He has a book you can buy if you prefer that, find it on no-starch press: https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2
These are my assorted programs I wrote as I followed along with the course.
